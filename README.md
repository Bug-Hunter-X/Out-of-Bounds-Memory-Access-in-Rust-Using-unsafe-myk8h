This repository contains a simple Rust program that demonstrates an out-of-bounds memory access. The program uses unsafe code to access an element beyond the bounds of a vector. The solution provides a corrected version that utilizes safe Rust methods to avoid the memory access violation.  This is a common error for developers new to unsafe Rust or those transitioning from other languages with less strict memory management.
